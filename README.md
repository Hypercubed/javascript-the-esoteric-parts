## Introduction

## Classical vs. Prototypal inheritance

JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance instead of classical inheritance.  Knowing the difference is key to understanding the discussions below.

- [Classical Inheritance in JavaScript](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html)
- [Why Prototypal Inheritance Matters](http://aaditmshah.github.io/why-prototypal-inheritance-matters/)
- [Benefits of prototypal inheritance over classical?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2800964/benefits-of-prototypal-inheritance-over-classical)

## The `new` and `this` keywords

Controversy over how to do class-like inheritance in JavaScript existed long before the ES6 `class` keyword.

## The ES6 `class`

ES6 introduced the `class` keyword.  ES6 classes are syntactical sugar over prototypal inheritance.  There are many arguments for and against the `class` keyword in JavaScript.

## Semicolons

JavaScript has a feature called Automatic semicolon insertion (ASI).  With ASI, you are able to omit certain semicolons.  Use of this feature is controversial.  After the `class` keyword, ASI may be JavaScript's most controversial syntactic feature.

## Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning, while not a feature of JavaScript, is vital to JavaScript package management and is often misunderstood.
